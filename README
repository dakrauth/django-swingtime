Swingtime is a Django application similar to a stripped down version of iCal for 
Mac OS X or Google Calendar. Swingtime provides an ``Event`` model that acts as 
a metadata container for one or more ``Occurrence`` objects, which in turn 
describe start and end times for a specific occurrence of an event.
